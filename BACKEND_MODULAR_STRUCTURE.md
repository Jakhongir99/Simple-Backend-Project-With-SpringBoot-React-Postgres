## 🗄️ Database Schema

### Tables

1. **users** - User authentication and management
2. **departments** - Company departments
3. **jobs** - Job positions and requirements
4. **employees** - Employee information and relationships

### Relationships

- **Employee** → **Department** (Many-to-One)
- **Employee** → **Job** (Many-to-One)
- **Employee** → **Employee** (Manager relationship)

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. **Modular Design**

- Each entity has its own package with DTOs, services, and controllers
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to maintain and extend

### 2. **Validation & Error Handling**

- Comprehensive input validation using Bean Validation
- Custom error messages
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Detailed logging for debugging

### 3. **Business Logic**

- Soft delete functionality
- Duplicate prevention (unique constraints)
- Relationship validation
- Computed fields (employee counts, average salaries)

### 4. **Performance & Scalability**

- Pagination support for large datasets
- Efficient database queries with indexes
- Lazy loading for relationships
- Transactional boundaries

### 5. **API Design**

- RESTful endpoints
- Consistent response formats
- Query parameters for filtering and sorting
- Cross-origin support

## 🔧 Configuration

### Liquibase Migrations

- **001-create-users-table.xml** - Users table
- **002-add-user-role.xml** - User roles
- **003-create-departments-table.xml** - Departments table
- **004-create-jobs-table.xml** - Jobs table
- **005-create-employees-table.xml** - Employees table

### Database

- PostgreSQL with JPA/Hibernate
- Automatic schema generation
- Sample data insertion

## 📊 Sample Data

Each module includes sample data for testing:

- **Departments**: IT, HR, Finance
- **Jobs**: Software Developer, HR Manager, Financial Analyst
- **Employees**: John Smith, Sarah Johnson, Michael Brown

## 🧪 Testing

The modular structure makes it easy to:

- Unit test individual services
- Integration test controllers
- Mock dependencies
- Test business logic in isolation

## 🔄 Future Enhancements

1. **Audit Trail**: Track all changes to entities
2. **Caching**: Redis integration for frequently accessed data
3. **File Upload**: Employee photos, document attachments
4. **Reporting**: Advanced analytics and reporting
5. **Notifications**: Email/SMS notifications for important events
6. **Workflow**: Approval processes for employee changes

## 📝 Usage Examples

### Creating a Department

```bash
POST /api/departments
{
  "name": "Marketing",
  "description": "Digital and traditional marketing",
  "location": "Building C, Floor 2",
  "budget": 250000.00
}
```

### Creating a Job

```bash
POST /api/jobs
{
  "title": "Marketing Specialist",
  "description": "Develop and execute marketing campaigns",
  "minSalary": 45000.00,
  "maxSalary": 75000.00,
  "requirements": "Bachelor's degree in Marketing",
  "benefits": "Health insurance, flexible hours"
}
```

### Creating an Employee

```bash
POST /api/employees
{
  "firstName": "Alice",
  "lastName": "Wilson",
  "email": "alice.wilson@company.com",
  "phone": "555-0104",
  "hireDate": "2024-01-15",
  "salary": 55000.00,
  "departmentId": 1,
  "jobId": 1
}
```

This modular architecture provides a solid foundation for a scalable enterprise application with clear separation of concerns and maintainable code structure.
